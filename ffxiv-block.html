            Final Fantasy XIV Online is one of the most notorious online MMORPG game with many branches
            of hobbies and interests not limited to crafting, raids, dungeons, quests, flexible classes,
            and so much more!
        </p>
    <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
            Here, we'll be zeroing in more towards FFXIV's fanbase community creativity in a blog/web-design hybrid
            where you can be here to simply socialize or dive into creating your own web-page that fellow FFXIV friends
            can check out let's say if they need better ideas for housing designs to making a web page directly towards
            a drink menu tailored towards your FFXIV venue!
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of this web-base is to be able to build a safe and friendly community where
            people can add or forward to friends creative ideas, provide assistance to those that are working on
            their creative ideas and pick and utilize structural templates in this hub customized
            to their own specific web design tastes for their FFXIV creations!
