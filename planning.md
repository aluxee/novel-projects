<p> Final Fantasy XIV is one of the most notorious online mmorpg game with many branches of hobbies and interests not limited to crafting, raids, dungeons, quests, flexible classes, and so much more [Y]
<p> Here, we’ll be zeroing in more towards FFXIV’s fanbase community creativity in a blog/web-design hybrid where you can be here to simply socialize or dive into creating your own web-page that fellow FFXIV friends can check out let’s say if they need better ideas for housing designs to making a web page directly towards a drink menu tailored towards your FFXIV venue! [Y]
<p> The goal of this web-base is to be able to build a safe and friendly community where people can add or forward to friends creative ideas, provide assistance to those that are working on their creative ideas and pick and utilize structural templates in this hub customized to their own specific web design tastes for their FFXIV creations!

A lot of communities in FFXIV use this social platform: https://www.discord.com

This website is truly great and on top of pricing updates for surfing through the marketboard world to world, data center to data center if you’re trying to figure out where to go to buy stuff off the marketboard: https://universalis.com/
Housing Sources:
Looking for a house but tired of physically searching from world to world in-game? Check this place out it is pretty accurate and up to date on both private/personal and Free Company housing: https://zhu.codes/paissa?world=407

Phase 2: Construction
Build your HTML site before CSS for 2 reasons:
1) Lets you focus on one language at a time as switching back and forth between languages can be difficult
2) More efficient to handle style and layout of page after you’ve made the HTML part
After it is done, test it to make sure it works (npm)
Phase 3: Styling
Try to be efficient and don’t hang up too much on re-using or not re-using your code, just focus on organization and clarity
